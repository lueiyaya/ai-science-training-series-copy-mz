**Application Area:** Material Science

**Use Case:** Materials Discovery and Design with LLMs

Integrating data and knowledge across physics, chemistry, and engineering, Large Language Models (LLMs) stand out 
in material science for their capacity to innovate in material design through cross-disciplinary integration. 
This integration enables the prediction of material properties before synthesis, significantly saving time and 
resources by avoiding the trial-and-error approach common in traditional methods. Furthermore, LLMs accelerate 
the discovery of new materials with desired properties, streamlining the development process and facilitating 
faster advancements in materials science.

**Evaluation Method:**
  
*  **Quantitative Analysis:** Use metrics like precision and recall calculated from a confusion matrix to quantitatively
assess the LLM's performance in prediction and data extraction tasks.

*  **Qualitative Analysis:** Incorporate feedback from domain experts on the practicality, innovation, and scientific
validity of the LLM's outputs, especially in design applications.
